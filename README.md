## Chapter 4: Summoning the Companion

> *Before you can summon this companion to your side, you must gather the  
> requisite components and speak the proper incantations.*

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ *(the arcane runtime)*
- A [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) API key *(your connection to the Weave)*
- A [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) project with Authentication enabled *(Google + Anonymous sign-in)*

---

### Step 1. Clone the Repository

*Reach through the planes and pull the source code to your local realm:*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hams-Ollo/The-Players-Companion.git
cd The-Players-Companion
npm install
```

### Step 2. Configure Your Secrets

*A wizard never reveals their secrets — but they do store them in `.env`:*

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your Gemini API key and Firebase config. See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for all available variables with descriptions.

> ⚠️ **Ward of Protection:** Never commit `.env` to version control. It is already guarded by `.gitignore`.

### Step 3. Upload Reference Tomes *(Optional)*

*For the truest answers, the DM must consult the original texts:*

```bash
npm run upload-pdfs
```

Place your D&D reference PDFs in `reference-docs/`, then run the command above. This uploads PDFs to Google's Gemini File API and writes the file URIs back to `.env`. On app startup, a context cache grounds all AI answers in actual book text with page citations.

### Step 4. Ignite the Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. Your companion awaits.

### Step 5. Forge for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Chapter 6: Cloud Persistence

> *"Trust not the localStorage alone, for it is as fleeting as a cantrip's flame.  
> Inscribe your heroes upon the eternal Firestore, and they shall endure."*

Signed-in users (Google Auth) receive **automatic Firestore synchronization**:

- Characters are stored in the `characters` collection, partitioned by `ownerUid`
- Real-time `onSnapshot` listeners keep multiple browser tabs and devices in sync
- Writes are **debounced** (500ms) to avoid excessive Firestore operations during heated combat
- Guest adventurers continue using localStorage with no cloud calls
- First-time sign-in detects local characters and offers a one-click **migration** to the cloud
- Firestore security rules enforce per-user isolation — no adventurer may read another's character sheet

---

## Chapter 7: Rate Limiting

> *"The Weave resists those who draw upon it too hastily.  
> Patience, young spellcaster — two seconds between castings."*

Client-side multi-layer protection prevents abuse of the AI connection:

- **Per-call throttle:** 2-second minimum between AI requests
- **Tamper detection:** Rate limit state stored in closure (not localStorage) — immune to console trickery

---

## Chapter 8: The Library

> than magic. These tomes contain the deeper lore of the Companion's construction."*
