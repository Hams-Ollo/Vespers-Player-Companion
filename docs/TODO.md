---

## 📦 Current Quest: v0.4.0 — Campaign Foundation & Party System (Phases 1–2) ✅

> *"The war council has assembled. The structures that unite  
> adventurers across the realm stand firm."*

### 🔴 Deadly

- [x] **Build `DMPartyOverview` component** — Live vitals grid, passive scores panel

## � SECURITY GATE: v0.4.1 — The Warding Circle (Blocks Public Launch)

> *"The strongest keep falls to a single unguarded gate. Before the realm is opened  
> to visitors, every ward must be inscribed, every seal tested, every secret hidden."*
>
> **⚠️ CRITICAL: Layers 1–2 are complete and removed client-side key exposure.**  
> Remaining work focuses on hardening (rules, cloud restrictions, headers, dependency hygiene)  
> before broad public sharing.

### 🔴 Deadly — Layer 1: Backend API Proxy (eliminates root cause)

- [x] **Create Express proxy server** (`server/index.ts`) — Serves static SPA files + proxies `/api/gemini/*` routes
- [x] **Firebase Admin SDK token verification** — Every `/api/*` request requires valid Firebase ID token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header; unauthenticated requests get `401`
- [x] **Refactor `lib/gemini.ts`** — Replace direct `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` calls with `fetch('/api/gemini/...')` + attach Firebase ID token from `auth.currentUser.getIdToken()`
- [x] **Remove `GEMINI_API_KEY` from Vite `define`** — Key must never appear in the client JS bundle
- [x] **Remove `VITE_GEMINI_FILE_URI_*` from client bundle** — Move D&D PDF file URIs to server-side environment only
- [x] **Update Dockerfile** — Replace nginx-only Stage 2 with Node Express (serves static `dist/` + proxy routes)
- [x] **Update `cloudbuild.yaml`** — Remove `GEMINI_API_KEY` from `--build-arg`; inject as Cloud Run **runtime** env var instead

### 🔴 Deadly — Layer 2: Server-Side Rate Limiting

- [x] **Per-user rate limiting** — In-memory map keyed by Firebase UID, 20 req/min per user
- [x] **Global rate limit fallback** — 200 req/min total across all users; prevents runaway if user pool spikes
- [x] **Rate limit response headers** — Return `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `Retry-After` so the client can show friendly UX

### 🟠 Hard — Layer 3: Debug & Logging Cleanup

- [x] **Strip API key `console.log` from `gemini.ts`** — No API key debug logging remains in the client helper
- [x] **Strip key prefix logging from `vite.config.ts`** — Vite config no longer logs key prefixes
- [ ] **Add production logging guard** — Wrap remaining debug logs in `if (import.meta.env.DEV)` checks

### 🟠 Hard — Layer 4: Firestore Rules Tightening

- [x] **Restrict invite `update` rule** — Fixed `toEmail` → `email` field reference; now only invite recipient or campaign DM can accept/decline
- [x] **Add field-type validation** — `firestore.rules` now type-checks `ownerUid` (string), `name` (string), `level` (int) on character create/update
- [x] **Add document size limits** — `request.resource.data.size() < 921600` (900 KB) enforced on character writes in `firestore.rules`
- [ ] **Scope local guest fallback** — Remove `guest-local-*` UID bypass or restrict it to localStorage-only path (no Firestore access)

### 🟡 Medium — Layer 5: Google Cloud Console Restrictions

- [ ] **Restrict Gemini API key** — Google Cloud Console → Credentials → restrict to Cloud Run service account/IP (no longer browser-accessible)
- [ ] **Restrict Firebase API key** — Add HTTP referrer restrictions to deployed domain(s) only
- [ ] **Set daily quota caps** — Billing safety net on Gemini key (e.g., 5000 req/day)

### 🟡 Medium — Layer 6: Security Headers & CSP

- [x] **Content Security Policy** — 13-directive CSP in `server/index.js` including `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `upgrade-insecure-requests`, and full connect-src allowlist
- [x] **HSTS header** — `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload` in `server/index.js`
- [x] **Permissions-Policy** — Server now sets `microphone=(self), camera=(), geolocation=()`

### 🟢 Easy — Layer 7: Dependency & Supply Chain

- [x] **Run `npm audit fix`** — 0 vulnerabilities; patched via `package.json` `overrides` for minimatch ≥ 10.2.1 and glob ≥ 10.5.1
- [ ] **Pin critical dependency versions** — Remove `^` semver ranges for `@google/genai`, `firebase`, `react`
- [ ] **Update `.env.example`** — Document which variables are build-time (Firebase config) vs runtime-only (Gemini key)

---
## 📦 v0.4.x — Character Sheet Parity & Export (D&D Beyond-Inspired)

> *"The hero's portrait grows clearer — every condition, every triumph,
> every earned point of experience now visible at a glance."*

### 🟠 Hard — Condition Tracking (pulled forward from v0.8.0+)

- [x] **Add `activeConditions`, `exhaustionLevel`, `heroicInspiration` to `CharacterData`** — New fields in `types.ts`; `activeConditions: string[]`, `exhaustionLevel: number (0-6)`, `heroicInspiration: boolean`
- [x] **Build `ConditionsModal.tsx`** — Checkbox list of all 15 conditions (reusing `CONDITIONS` from `constants.tsx`), exhaustion level picker (0-6), persisted to Firestore
- [ ] **Wire "Conditions" button into `CombatStrip`** — Opens conditions modal, shows active condition count badge
- [x] **Display active conditions on Dashboard header** — Condition badges/chips visible at a glance; active conditions strip auto-shows in Dashboard header; Conditions button carries count badge

### 🟡 Medium — Character Sheet Enhancements

- [x] **Heroic Inspiration toggle** — Sparkles icon button near portrait in `Dashboard.tsx`; pulses amber when active; one-tap on/off
- [x] **Passive Investigation & Passive Insight** — Compute `10 + skill modifier` for Investigation and Insight; displayed in Passive Scores section of `SkillsDetail.tsx`
- [x] **XP tracking & progress display** — `xp: number` on `CharacterData`; amber progress bar in `VitalsDetail.tsx`; XP input field side-by-side with Level in `SettingsModal.tsx`

### 🟡 Medium — Portrait Experience

- [x] **Portrait fullscreen lightbox** — New `PortraitLightbox.tsx`; clicking the portrait in `Dashboard` opens a fullscreen overlay with ESC/click-outside dismiss and "Regenerate Portrait" / "Change Image" CTA buttons; portrait generator no longer opens directly on portrait click
- [x] **Richer regeneration description default** — `PortraitGenerator` now builds its default description from `race`, `class`, `subclass`, and `background` (where available); previously only used `race class`
- [x] **Camera selfie as portrait base** — Dedicated `capture="user"` file input in `PortraitGenerator`'s Image to Image tab renders as a "Use Camera / Take Selfie" button; image is passed to Gemini for fantasy redraw and is never persisted directly
- [x] **Privacy disclosure (one-time consent)** — Inline `ShieldCheck` notice in Image to Image tab explains upload data use; dismissed with "I Understand" and remembered in `localStorage` as `portrait_image_consent_v1`
- [x] **Client-side upload size guard** — `handleFileSelect` rejects files over 10 MB before base64 conversion with a user-facing error message
- [x] **Lift camera Permissions-Policy block** — `server/index.js` updated from `camera=()` to `camera=(self)` so the browser camera API is available to same-origin pages; required for `<input capture>` and future `getUserMedia` use

### 🟡 Medium — Character Management

- [x] **Character cloning ("Duplicate")** — Amber Copy button on character card in `CharacterSelection.tsx`; `handleClone()` deep-copies + new UUID + appends "(Copy)" + clears campaign binding

### 🟠 Hard — Character Export & Import

- [x] **Native JSON export/import** — Export: `SettingsModal.tsx` downloads `Name_lvlN.json` blob; Import: "Import Hero" card in `CharacterSelection.tsx` uses FileReader to parse and enroll character
- [ ] **PDF character sheet export** — Standard 5e sheet via `jspdf`

### 🟡 Medium — Export Formats

- [ ] **FoundryVTT export** — Transform to FoundryVTT actor JSON schema
- [ ] **D&D Beyond format export** — Transform to D&D Beyond-compatible JSON
- [ ] **Export UI** — Format picker (JSON / PDF / FoundryVTT / D&D Beyond)

- [ ] **Wire premade selection to `CharacterCreationWizard`** — Populates wizard state, skips to review/confirm step
