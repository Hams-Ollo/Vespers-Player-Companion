### 🟡 Medium

- [ ] **Add SRD monster data** — `lib/monsters.ts` with ~300 SRD creatures

---

## 📦 Current Quest: v0.4.0 — Campaign Foundation & Party System (Phases 1–2) ✅

> *"The war council has assembled. The structures that unite  
> adventurers across the realm stand firm."*

### 🔴 Deadly

- [x] **Firestore campaign subcollection structure** — `campaigns/{id}/members`, `/encounters`, `/notes`, `/templates`, `/whispers`, `/rollRequests`
- [x] **Create `lib/campaigns.ts` service layer** — Full campaign CRUD with real-time subscriptions
- [x] **Update Firestore security rules** — Campaign member reads, DM-only writes, invite rules
- [x] **Create `CampaignContext` provider** — `useCampaign()` hook with campaigns, members, roles
- [x] **Wire `CampaignProvider` into `App.tsx`** — Remove localStorage campaign state, wrap with provider
- [x] **Rewrite `CampaignManager` component** — Replace localStorage with `useCampaign()`

### 🟠 Hard

- [x] **DM/Player role selection** — DM role confirmation badge at campaign creation
- [x] **Character-to-campaign assignment** — Dropdown picker at join, invite accept, and post-join change
- [x] **Build `PartyRoster` component** — Grid of party member cards with portraits; DM kick button for removing members
- [x] **Build `DMPartyOverview` component** — Live vitals grid, passive scores panel
- [x] **Build `DMDashboard` layout** — DM-specific layout when `myRole === 'dm'`; `allowPlayerInvites` toggle; regenerate join code
- [x] **Invite management** — Join code sharing (prominent copy-paste) + email invites + accept/decline flow + 7-day expiry + duplicate prevention
- [ ] **Migrate localStorage campaigns to Firestore** — Migration function

### 🟡 Medium

---

## � SECURITY GATE: v0.4.1 — The Warding Circle (Blocks Public Launch)

> *"The strongest keep falls to a single unguarded gate. Before the realm is opened  
> to visitors, every ward must be inscribed, every seal tested, every secret hidden."*
>
> **⚠️ CRITICAL: Layers 1–2 are complete and removed client-side key exposure.**  
> Remaining work focuses on hardening (rules, cloud restrictions, headers, dependency hygiene)  
> before broad public sharing.

### 🔴 Deadly — Layer 1: Backend API Proxy (eliminates root cause)

- [x] **Create Express proxy server** (`server/index.ts`) — Serves static SPA files + proxies `/api/gemini/*` routes
- [x] **Firebase Admin SDK token verification** — Every `/api/*` request requires valid Firebase ID token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header; unauthenticated requests get `401`
- [x] **Refactor `lib/gemini.ts`** — Replace direct `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` calls with `fetch('/api/gemini/...')` + attach Firebase ID token from `auth.currentUser.getIdToken()`
- [x] **Remove `GEMINI_API_KEY` from Vite `define`** — Key must never appear in the client JS bundle
- [x] **Remove `VITE_GEMINI_FILE_URI_*` from client bundle** — Move D&D PDF file URIs to server-side environment only
- [x] **Update Dockerfile** — Replace nginx-only Stage 2 with Node Express (serves static `dist/` + proxy routes)
- [x] **Update `cloudbuild.yaml`** — Remove `GEMINI_API_KEY` from `--build-arg`; inject as Cloud Run **runtime** env var instead

### 🔴 Deadly — Layer 2: Server-Side Rate Limiting

- [x] **Per-user rate limiting** — In-memory map keyed by Firebase UID, 20 req/min per user
- [x] **Global rate limit fallback** — 200 req/min total across all users; prevents runaway if user pool spikes
- [x] **Rate limit response headers** — Return `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `Retry-After` so the client can show friendly UX

### 🟠 Hard — Layer 3: Debug & Logging Cleanup

- [x] **Strip API key `console.log` from `gemini.ts`** — No API key debug logging remains in the client helper
- [x] **Strip key prefix logging from `vite.config.ts`** — Vite config no longer logs key prefixes
- [ ] **Add production logging guard** — Wrap remaining debug logs in `if (import.meta.env.DEV)` checks

### 🟠 Hard — Layer 4: Firestore Rules Tightening

- [x] **Restrict invite `update` rule** — Fixed `toEmail` → `email` field reference; now only invite recipient or campaign DM can accept/decline
- [ ] **Add field-type validation** — Enforce string/number types on `ownerUid`, `name`, `level`, etc. in security rules
- [ ] **Add document size limits** — `request.resource.data.size() < N` on character writes to prevent abuse
- [ ] **Scope local guest fallback** — Remove `guest-local-*` UID bypass or restrict it to localStorage-only path (no Firestore access)

### 🟡 Medium — Layer 5: Google Cloud Console Restrictions

- [ ] **Restrict Gemini API key** — Google Cloud Console → Credentials → restrict to Cloud Run service account/IP (no longer browser-accessible)
- [ ] **Restrict Firebase API key** — Add HTTP referrer restrictions to deployed domain(s) only
- [ ] **Set daily quota caps** — Billing safety net on Gemini key (e.g., 5000 req/day)

### 🟡 Medium — Layer 6: Security Headers & CSP

- [ ] **Content Security Policy** — `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' *.googleapis.com *.firebaseio.com`
- [ ] **HSTS header** — `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- [x] **Permissions-Policy** — Server now sets `microphone=(self), camera=(), geolocation=()`

### 🟢 Easy — Layer 7: Dependency & Supply Chain

- [ ] **Run `npm audit fix`** — Resolve known vulnerabilities before public launch
- [ ] **Pin critical dependency versions** — Remove `^` semver ranges for `@google/genai`, `firebase`, `react`
- [ ] **Update `.env.example`** — Document which variables are build-time (Firebase config) vs runtime-only (Gemini key)

## 📦 v0.4.x — Character Sheet Parity & Export (D&D Beyond-Inspired)
