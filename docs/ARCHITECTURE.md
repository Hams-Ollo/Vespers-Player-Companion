The app is a **fully client-side SPA** — no backend server stands between the adventurer and their data. Character state persists in **Cloud Firestore** for signed-in users and `localStorage` for guest adventurers. AI calls travel directly from the browser to Google's Gemini API. Firebase guards the gates of authentication.

## Chapter 3: Component Map

> *Every chamber in the Companion has a purpose. Here is the registry,  
> organized by the layer of the keep in which each component dwells.*

## Chapter 4: The Data Model

> *"A character is more than a name and a sword. Here lies the schema  
> that defines every hero in the Companion's vault."*

### 📊 Core Type: `CharacterData`

```typescript
interface CharacterData {
  id: string;
  ownerUid?: string;                     // Firebase Auth UID (cloud users)
  createdAt?: number;                    // epoch ms
  updatedAt?: number;                    // epoch ms (auto-set on every save)
  name: string;
  race: string;
  class: string;
  background?: string;
  alignment?: string;
  level: number;
  campaign?: string;
  portraitUrl: string;
  stats: Record<StatKey, Stat>;       // STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA
  hp: { current: number; max: number };
  hitDice: { current: number; max: number; die: string };
  ac: number;
  initiative: number;
  speed: number;
  passivePerception: number;
  skills: Skill[];                     // 18 D&D skills
  attacks: Attack[];
  features: Feature[];
  spells: Spell[];
  spellSlots: { level: number; current: number; max: number }[];
  inventory: { gold: number; items: Item[]; load: string };
  journal: JournalEntry[];
}
```

See `types.ts` for all interfaces (`Stat`, `Skill`, `Attack`, `Feature`, `Spell`, `Item`, `JournalEntry`, `Campaign`, `UserProfile`, `RollResult`).

### 💽 Persistence

> *Where do heroes go when the browser closes?*

| Data | Storage (Google Users) | Storage (Guests) | Key / Collection |
|:-----|:----------------------|:------------------|:-----------------|
| Characters | Cloud Firestore | `localStorage` | `characters` collection / `vesper_chars` |
| Campaigns | Cloud Firestore | `localStorage` | `campaigns` collection / `vesper_campaigns` |
| Auth Session | Firebase Auth | Firebase Auth / local | Managed by Firebase SDK |

**Firestore Schema:**
- Collection: `characters` (top-level)
- Document ID: `character.id` (client-generated UUID)
- Partition field: `ownerUid` (Firebase Auth UID)
- Composite index: `ownerUid` ASC + `updatedAt` DESC
- Security rules: Users can only read/write documents where `ownerUid == auth.uid`

**Dual-mode logic** is managed by `CharacterContext`:
- On auth change: subscribes to Firestore (`onSnapshot`) for Google users, loads localStorage for guests
- Writes are debounced (500ms) to avoid excessive Firestore operations during combat
- Failed Firestore connections fall back to localStorage

## Chapter 5: AI Integration

> *"The Weave connects all magic in the world.  
> Through it, the Companion channels the power of Gemini."*

### Models Used

| Model | Purpose | Summoned By |
|:------|:--------|:------------|
| `gemini-2.5-flash` | Text generation (rules, level-up, DM chat, quick roll) | `lib/gemini.ts` → `LevelUpModal`, `AskDMModal`, `ItemDetailModal`, `JournalDetail`, `QuickRollModal` |
| `gemini-2.5-flash-image` | Image generation (portraits) | `lib/gemini.ts` → `CharacterCreationWizard`, `PortraitGenerator`, `QuickRollModal` |

### The Gemini Client (`lib/gemini.ts`)

Three exported incantations:

- **`generateWithContext(prompt, config?)`** — Single-shot text generation
- **`createChatWithContext(history, systemInstruction)`** — Multi-turn chat session
- **`generatePortrait(prompt, parts?)`** — Image generation via `gemini-2.5-flash-image`, returns base64 data URI or null

All use the `GEMINI_API_KEY` injected by Vite at build time via `process.env.API_KEY`. The `getAI()` private factory validates the key exists before creating a `GoogleGenAI` instance.
