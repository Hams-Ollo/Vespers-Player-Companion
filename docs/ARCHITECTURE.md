The app is a **mobile-first SPA** served by an Express proxy server on Cloud Run. Character state persists in **Cloud Firestore** for signed-in users and `localStorage` for guest adventurers. AI calls route through the Express proxy (which holds the Gemini API key). **Firebase Cloud Functions v2** handle server-side data consistency — specifically, Firestore document triggers that keep `campaign.memberUids` in sync when members join or leave. Firebase guards the gates of authentication.

## Chapter 4: The Data Model

> *"A character is more than a name and a sword. Here lies the schema  
> that defines every hero in the Companion's vault."*

### 📊 Core Type: `CharacterData`

```typescript
interface CharacterData {
  id: string;
  ownerUid?: string;                     // Firebase Auth UID (cloud users)
  createdAt?: number;                    // epoch ms
  updatedAt?: number;                    // epoch ms (auto-set on every save)
  name: string;
  race: string;
  class: string;
  background?: string;
  alignment?: string;
  level: number;
  campaign?: string;                     // display name (e.g. "Firestorm")
  campaignId?: string;                   // Firestore campaign doc ID (synced with members subcollection)
  portraitUrl: string;
  stats: Record<StatKey, Stat>;       // STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA
  hp: { current: number; max: number };
  hitDice: { current: number; max: number; die: string };
  ac: number;
  initiative: number;
  speed: number;
  passivePerception: number;
  skills: Skill[];                     // 18 D&D skills
  attacks: Attack[];
  features: Feature[];
  spells: Spell[];
  spellSlots: { level: number; current: number; max: number }[];
  inventory: { gold: number; items: Item[]; load: string };
  journal: JournalEntry[];
}
```

See `types.ts` for all interfaces (`Stat`, `Skill`, `Attack`, `Feature`, `Spell`, `Item`, `JournalEntry`, `Campaign`, `UserProfile`, `RollResult`).

### 💽 Persistence

> *Where do heroes go when the browser closes?*

| Data | Storage (Google Users) | Storage (Guests) | Key / Collection |
|:-----|:----------------------|:------------------|:-----------------|
| Characters | Cloud Firestore | `localStorage` | `characters` collection / `vesper_chars` |
| Campaigns | Cloud Firestore | — *(auth required)* | `campaigns` collection + subcollections |
| Invites | Cloud Firestore | — *(auth required)* | `invites` collection |
| Auth Session | Firebase Auth | Firebase Auth / local | Managed by Firebase SDK |

**Firestore Schema:**
- Collection: `characters` (top-level)
- Document ID: `character.id` (client-generated UUID)
- Partition field: `ownerUid` (Firebase Auth UID)
- Composite index: `ownerUid` ASC + `updatedAt` DESC
- Security rules: Users can only read/write documents where `ownerUid == auth.uid`

**Dual-mode logic** is managed by `CharacterContext`:
- On auth change: subscribes to Firestore (`onSnapshot`) for Google users, loads localStorage for guests
- Writes are debounced (500ms) to avoid excessive Firestore operations during combat
- Failed Firestore connections fall back to localStorage

**Campaign Firestore Schema:**
- Collection: `campaigns` (top-level) with subcollections: `members`, `encounters`, `notes`, `templates`, `whispers`, `rollRequests`
- Collection: `invites` (top-level) — join code + email invite tracking
- Members subcollection stores `uid`, `displayName`, `role` (`dm`/`player`), and optional `characterId`
- Character–campaign membership is synced bidirectionally: `CharacterData.campaignId` \u2194 `campaigns/{id}/members/{uid}`
- **Cloud Functions v2** automatically sync `campaign.memberUids[]` via Firestore document triggers (`onDocumentCreated` / `onDocumentDeleted` on `campaigns/{campaignId}/members/{memberId}`)
- Security rules enforce campaign membership — only members can read/write subcollection data
- Campaign creation automatically assigns the creator as DM
- DM can remove members from the party via the `PartyRoster` kick button
- DM can toggle `allowPlayerInvites` in campaign settings; when enabled, players can also send invites
- DM can regenerate the join code to invalidate old links
- Invites include a 7-day expiry (`expiresAt` timestamp); duplicate pending invites are prevented
- Invite flow: DM (or player if allowed) shares join code or sends email invite → player accepts → added to members subcollection → Cloud Function syncs `memberUids`

## Chapter 5: AI Integration

> *"The Weave connects all magic in the world.  
> Through it, the Companion channels the power of Gemini."*

### Models Used

| Model | Purpose | Summoned By |
|:------|:--------|:------------|
| `gemini-2.5-flash` | Text generation (rules, level-up, DM chat, quick roll) | `lib/gemini.ts` → `LevelUpModal`, `AskDMModal`, `ItemDetailModal`, `JournalDetail`, `QuickRollModal` |
| `gemini-2.5-flash-image` | Image generation (portraits) | `lib/gemini.ts` → `CharacterCreationWizard`, `PortraitGenerator`, `QuickRollModal` |

### The Gemini Client (`lib/gemini.ts`)

Three exported incantations:

- **`generateWithContext(prompt, config?)`** — Single-shot text generation
- **`createChatWithContext(history, systemInstruction)`** — Multi-turn chat session
- **`generatePortrait(prompt, parts?)`** — Image generation via `gemini-2.5-flash-image`, returns base64 data URI or null

All AI calls route through the **Express API proxy** at `/api/gemini/*`. The client attaches a Firebase ID token via `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The proxy server holds the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in its runtime environment (injected via Cloud Run secrets or `.env` locally) and forwards requests to the Gemini API. The API key **never** appears in the browser bundle.

### The Express Proxy (`server/index.js`)

| Route | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| `POST /api/gemini/generate` | Single-shot text generation |
| `POST /api/gemini/chat` | Multi-turn chat |
| `POST /api/gemini/portrait` | Image generation |
| `POST /api/gemini/live-token` | Ephemeral token for live audio transcription |
| `GET /api/health` | Health check |
| `GET /*` | Serves static `dist/` files (production) |

**Middleware pipeline:** Firebase token verification → per-user rate limiter (20/min) → global rate limiter (200/min) → Gemini proxy.

## Chapter 6: Cloud Functions

> *"Invisible servants toil behind the scenes, keeping the realm's ledgers in perfect order."*

Firebase Cloud Functions v2 (located in `functions/src/index.ts`) provide server-side data consistency that cannot be handled safely from the client.

### Functions

| Function | Trigger | Purpose |
|:---------|:--------|:--------|
| `onMemberCreated` | `onDocumentCreated('campaigns/{campaignId}/members/{memberId}')` | Adds the new member's UID to `campaign.memberUids[]` via `arrayUnion` |
| `onMemberDeleted` | `onDocumentDeleted('campaigns/{campaignId}/members/{memberId}')` | Removes the member's UID from `campaign.memberUids[]` via `arrayRemove` (with campaign existence check) |

### Why Cloud Functions?

The `memberUids` array on the campaign document is used for `array-contains` queries (e.g., "find all campaigns this user belongs to"). Firestore security rules restrict campaign document updates to the DM — but when a non-DM player joins via invite code, they can't update the campaign doc. Cloud Functions run with admin privileges, bypassing security rules to keep `memberUids` in sync automatically.

### Deployment

Cloud Functions deploy automatically via the Cloud Build pipeline (Step 4 in `cloudbuild.yaml`). For manual deployment:

```bash
cd functions && npm install && npm run build
firebase deploy --only functions --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```
